# Design Review Report

Based on the latest desktop, tablet, and mobile screenshots, here is an evaluation of the laptop repair website.

## Overall Rating
- **Score:** 9.5 / 10
- **Verdict:** The experience is polished, personable, and tailored to the technician’s brand while staying laser-focused on high-value repairs.

## Alignment With Client Goals
- **Personal Service — 10/10:** Prominent "Serwis Yury" branding, the Belarusian flag in the footer, and the friendly language note in the contact area reinforce the owner-operated feel.
- **Professional Appearance — 10/10:** The purple neon aesthetic looks modern yet trustworthy, and the layout scales cleanly from desktop to mobile. Iconography and spacing keep dense info readable.
- **Clear Services — 10/10:** Messaging centers on complex laptop and computer repairs, with a dedicated console section covering PlayStation and Xbox work. The notice panel clarifies that phones and tablets are out of scope, preventing mismatched inquiries.
- **Laptop Buyback Form — 10/10:** The dedicated form requests model details, contact info, and an expected price. It guides the seller toward realistic valuations.
- **Trust Builders — 9/10:** Transparent "from" pricing, honest expectations about diagnostics, and visible contact channels build credibility. Customer testimonials remain the only missing lever.

## Fit For A Belarusian Technician Working In Poland
1. **Language:** Polish copy reaches the primary audience while acknowledging multilingual support (Belarusian, Russian, English).
2. **Cultural Bridge:** Personal touches (flag, language note) ease rapport with both local and Eastern European customers.
3. **Positioning:** Reframing complex board-level work as the default service differentiates the technician from commodity repair shops.

## Opportunities
- Add a testimonial or before/after gallery to further reinforce trust.
- Consider a brief FAQ answering shipping, diagnostics, and turnaround time questions.
